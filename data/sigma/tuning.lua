-- CHANGES in Tellurian 2.10 (as of 06/01/2023), relative to Tellurian 2.9.14:
--
-- Damage reduction from loner altered; was 0.25x for all sizes, but is now 0.9x for small size creatures, sliding up to 0.4x for size 10s.
-- Disorienting Barbs radius increased from 4 to 10. Duration increased from 64 ticks to 80 ticks.
-- Quill burst base radius increased from 7m to 10m. Damage marginally increased at levels 1, 2, 3 and 4.
-- Hench heal range slashed from 27.5m to 20m. 
-- Hench heal rate reduced from 5 hp/s to 4 hp/s.
-- Deflect chance reduced to 20% at every size (formerly went from 25% to 30%, increasing with size).
-- Rock and Water projectile speed increased from 35 to 42.
